**We're a nonprofit organization dedicated to developing a free & open-source augmentative and alternative communication tool for individuals with speech challenges. [Check out our website ‚ûö](https://spark4speech.com/)**

## About Us

SPARK (Speech Personalized Access Resource Kit) is a nonprofit organization that develops free and open-source tools for individuals with speech challenges. We believe that communication is a fundamental human right, and our mission is to empower people who experience speech difficulties by providing accessible and customizable augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) tools. 

Through collaboration with the open-source community, we are creating solutions that are both innovative and inclusive, aiming to enhance communication for all.

Hand in hand with open-source software, one of our largest core values is **transparency**. Our always free and open-source code is not the only thing we're transparent about. [We've completely open sourced our finances and legal documents](https://hcb.hackclub.com/spark4speech).

## Vision & Mission

To make communication tools universally accessible for individuals with speech challenges, empowering them to express themselves freely and with dignity.

We are committed to providing open-source, customizable, and accessible AAC solutions that meet the unique needs of individuals across the globe.
